= KEGG on Rails

This directory contains a snapshot of an experimental project 'KEGG on Rails'
which enhances KEGG's pathway view by Rails and AJAX.

== Requirements

* BioRuby 1.1.0-pre3 (or newer)
* Ruby on Rails 1.2.3
* SQLite3 (or MySQL)

  % gem install rails -y
  % gem install sqlite3-ruby
  (% gem install mysql)

== Installation

Download files from

  http://bioruby.org/archive/contrib/kegg_on_rails/

=== Rails application

Unpack KEGG on Rails application.

  % tar zxvf kegg_on_rails_20070414.tar.gz

=== KEGG data

Sample data file which only contains E. coli data is provided
(Note that this file is licenced under the same terms as KEGG).

  % tar zxvf kegg_on_rails_data_20070414.tar.gz

== Setup

Load sample data with rake command.

  % cd kegg
  % rake db:migrate
  % rake kegg:load_all > data/linkdbs.txt

Or you can use pre-loaded 'db/development.sqlite3' file downloaded from

  http://bioruby.org/archive/contrib/kegg_on_rails/supplement/development.sqlite3

If you want to use MySQL instead of SQLite3, change the symbolic link of
database.yml file in config directory to database.yml.mysql file and modify.

== Run

Start the webrick server

  % ./script/server

and open

  http://localhost:3000/pathway/

then select a pathway from the list (e.g. map00010)

  http://localhost:3000/pathway/show/map00010

and click on the rectangles or circles to get popup window by AJAX.

You can also change organism and/or pathways via hierarchical selector
if you have loaded relevant data.

  http://localhost:3000/pathway/show/eco00020

== Customize

You can mirror the KEGG database for other organisms from

  ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg

and put it into the 'data/kegg' subdirectory instead of E. coli sample data.
You need to modify 'lib/kegg_config.rb' file to load them.

The pathway view is in Japanese mode by default but you can change it
to English mode by replacing 'app/controllers/pathway_controller.rb' with

  http://bioruby.org/archive/contrib/kegg_on_rails/supplement/pathway_controller.rb.en
